1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
var is function-scoped, can be used before declaration, and can be reassigned.
let is block-scoped, cannot be used before declaration, but can be reassigned.
const is also block-scoped, cannot be used before declaration, and cannot be reassigned.

2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
map() creates a new array with modified values,
forEach() only loops through items without returning anything, and
filter() creates a new array with items that meet a condition.

3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions using =>.
They donâ€™t have their own this but use this from the parent scope, making code shorter and cleaner.

5) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Destructuring is a shortcut to take values from arrays or objects and store them in variables.
Example: [a, b] = [10, 20] or {name, age} = person.

7) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Template literals use backticks (`) instead of quotes. They allow multi-line strings and easy variable insertion with ${}.
This is simpler and cleaner than using +` for string concatenation.
